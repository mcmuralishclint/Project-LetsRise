# Project-LetsRise
A Yelp-like web application for connecting small businesses based in China

## Problem Definition
There are many entreprenuers in China working on several startups and businesses. As a freelancer based in China, problems that I faced were:
- I couldn't find an entrepreneur apart from the ones in my circle.
- It was difficult for people to reach out to me since marketing does not work the same way as it does in the other countries.
- It was difficult to find a legit business in China since many businesses are being formed everyday and the demand for quality and legit businesses were always high.
- Wechat groups have a limit of 500 members and it is very difficult to create a platform in wechat for foreigners in China to know about each other.

## Solution
Analyzing the problem and through realizing that there were no other startups in this field, I thought that I could create a baseline for anyone willing to start this startup. (If possible, I would work on this myself). I thought that certain features are necessary for this application and got inspired from Yelp.com to work on this project.

## Required features
- Login/Signup for members
- Post ads
- Blog posts
- Give ratings for ads of businesses
- Personally reviewing and checking the authenticity of a business before posting it
- Search for businesses on the application
- A custom profile page and getting matched with entrepreurs with similar interests

## Project Planning
To start off with the project, I created a plan and decided to allocate some time and work on it. I created a Gantt chart in excel and allocated my time according to the schedule.
